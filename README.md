<!---
I am Brennan Sigwan Taracatac./ A simple 18-year-old boy who is dreaming for a simple yet successful life. A boy who wants to achieve his dream for his love ones. As for me to achieve my dream, I am currently studying at Dr. Filemon C. Aguilar Memorial College of Las Piñas as a first-year BSIS student. I also once became an Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM) student back in senior high school at Las Piñas City National Senior High School – CAA Campus. Actually, Accountancy, Business and Management is not the field of my study. I just forced by my mom. Ever since I am really interested at computer related course. So, I realize that I want to take Bachelor of Science in Information System course here in DFCAMCLP. And luckily I am accepted through this prestige school. I am close to my dream so I promise to myself that I will study hard for the better future of mine and my family.
One of talent and also my hobby is playing mobile games. I can say that I am good at playing games and I am always the captain of the game. I am not the best of the best but I can assure you that once you saw me playing mobile games you will be astonished by my skill. Also when I have a free time I am biking, because it makes me fit and helps me to relieve my stress. This also makes me active and healthy. That’s all, thank you!
